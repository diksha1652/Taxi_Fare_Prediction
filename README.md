In the last few years, the number of for-hire vehicles operating in NYC has grown from 63,000 to more than 100,000.However, while the number of trips in app-based vehicles has increased from 6 million to 17 million a year, taxi trips have fallen from 11 million to 8.5 million.
Hence, the NYC Yellow Cab organization decided to become more data centric.
Then we have apps like Uber, OLA, Lyft, Gett, etc. how do these apps work? After all, that set price is not a random guess.
